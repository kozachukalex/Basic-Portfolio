                <h2> About Me </h2>

                <img src="images/bender_pic.png" alt="My Picture" id="bio-image">

                <p> My name is Alex Kozachuk and I was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I attended school at the Center for Emergency
                    Medicine in Pittsburgh where I obtained my EMT certifications as well as my CPR Instructor certifications.
                    While in school, I met my future wife and we have been married for almost 2 years. After living in Pittsburgh
                    for about 8 years, we moved to Charlotte where I gained employment with Rite Aid pharmacy training their
                    technicians and wellness ambassadors in addition to contracting vaccine clinics and health fairs. After
                    spending 3 years in Charlotte, my wife and I moved to Raleigh in November of 2017.
                </p>

                <div style="clear: both">
                    <p> In my spare time, I enjoy going to anything food related whether its trucks, breweries, festivals, or
                        anything in between. My favorite meal is chicken carbonara. My favorite brewery so far in Raleigh
                        is between Big Boss, who has an amazing playlist of all the bands I listened to during high school,
                        and Little City that always has great sours available; try the
                        <em> Plethora.</em> I am also an avid gamer, having been heavily involved in the
                        <em> Paragon </em>
                        community prior to the game being shut down. </p>

                    <p> I look forward to learning about web development and all the opportunities this new career path can offer
                        me. Ideally, I would like to use my knowledge and skills gained to work specifically in the food
                        industry or gaming industry. The best path is to most likely use my medical background to first gain
                        an opportunity to further develop my skills and gain work experience in the field.
